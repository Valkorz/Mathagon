Question: What is the probability of event A occurring?

Given:
- Total number of possible outcomes: #
- Number of favorable outcomes for event A: #

Solution:
To calculate the probability of event A occurring, divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:

Probability of event A = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

Substituting the given values:
Probability of event A = # / #

Therefore, the probability of event A occurring is #.
